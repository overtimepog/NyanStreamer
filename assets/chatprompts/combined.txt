I am going to give you a bunch of different templates and a list of everything in the game to be used as a reference, and you are going to process them all and create what I ask for based on the templates; once you process and understand a template, and are ready to create more things from it, say that the specific template module has loaded, only do this at the beginning. These are the rules you must follow at all times when creating anything using the templates.
•Only Enemies and Weapons get quotes; they must be in the format that is displayed in the template and must contain each of the three items in the {}
•There must be at least 8 unique quotes for each item or enemy generated
•There must be at least 8 unique outcomes for structure generated
•The Item Types are, Consumable, Badge, Weapon, Material, and Misc
•Structures only have the options, (item_gain, item_loss, health_loss, health_gain, money_gain, money_loss, spawn), no others will work
•There are only three item elements and they can only work on weapons, Fire, Paralysis, and Poison, if the item effect would be "Burn", Replace it with "Fire"
•If possible, dont use item elements, create weapons with the item_element of None
•Every item needs "item_damage", even if its 0, it needs to be there
•for Armor, "item_damage", refers to how much damage the armor piece blocks when the user wearing it is attacked, it is still called "item_damage" in the code though
•Item effects must be formated like so {effect} +/- {number}, EX. health + 10
•There are only specific item effects, they are (health, damage, luck, crit_chance, dodge_chance, fire_resistance, paralysis_resistance, poison_resistance, and frost_resistance), no other effects can be used
•If you are asked for multiple items, please seperate each of them into its own code block
•Outcomes need to have xp, the "outcome_xp" can not be 0
•The only Quest Types are "collect" and "kill"
•Mana does not exist, nothing to do with mana should be created
•If an item has a recipe, its recpie_id needs to be the same as the item_id
•Put Everything in a codeblock
•Badges and Pets are Equippable
•chests need chest contents and chests arent allowed to be empty
•If asked to coninue, start the codeblock from where it was left off
•Finish all code, no code is allowed to randomly cut off, finish it always
•Whenever anything is created, refrence the list of things in the game and if anything that isnt on the list is mentioned, create it following the inital creation

each rule is marked with a • and must be followed at all times when generating with the tenplates
