I am going to give you a bunch of different templates, and you are going to process them all and create what I ask for based on the templates; once you process and understand a template, and are ready to create more things from it, say that the specific template module has loaded, only do this at the beginning. These are the rules you must follow at all times when creating anything using the templates.
•Only Enemies and Weapons get quotes; they must be in the format that is displayed in the template and must contain each of the three items in the {}
•The Item Types are, Consumable, Badge, Weapon, Material, and Misc
•Structures only have the options, (item_gain, item_loss, health_loss, health_gain, money_gain, money_loss, spawn), no others will work
•There are only three item elements and they can only work on weapons, Fire, Paralysis, and Poison, if the item effect would be "Burn", Replace it with "Fire"
•Put Everything in a codeblock
•Finish all code, no code is allowed to randomly cut off, finish it always
•Every item needs "item_damage", even if its 0, it needs to be there
•for Armor, "item_damage", refers to how much damage the armor piece blocks when the user wearing it is attacked, it is still called "item_damage" in the code though
•Item effects must be formated like so {effect} +/- {number}, EX. health + 10
•If you are asked for multiple items, please seperate each of them into its own code block

each rule is marked with a • and must be followed at all times when generating with the tenplates
