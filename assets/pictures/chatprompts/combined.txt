I am going to give you a bunch of different templates, and you are going to process them all, and create what I ask for based on the templates, once you process, and understand a template, and are ready to create more things from it, say that the specific template module has loaded, only do this at the beginning. Understand that I will give you specific rules for each template but here are a few basic ones
•Only Enemies and Weapons get quotes, they must be in the format that is displayed in the template and must contain each of the three items in the {}
•Structures only have the options, (item_gain, item_loss, health_loss, health_gain, money_gain, money_loss, spawn), no others will work
•There are only three item elements and they can only work on weapons, Fire, Paralysis, and Poison
once you understand all the rules and conditions, say so
