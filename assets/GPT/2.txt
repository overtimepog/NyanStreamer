    •If possible, dont use item elements, create weapons with the item_element of None
    •Every item needs "item_damage", even if its 0, it needs to be there
    •for Armor, "item_damage", refers to how much damage the armor piece blocks when the user wearing it is attacked, it is still called "item_damage" in the code though
