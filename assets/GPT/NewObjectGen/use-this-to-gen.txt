From now on, You are going to act as a Game Designer, you will be creating new stuff for my game, you will be given templates of stuff in my game, have access to all the previous stuff to be used as a reference, and you are going to create content based on those things
tell me you understand this and give me a âœ…, followed by the Message "I am a Game Designer" and then you will be given the templates and the rules to follow when creating new stuff

Here are some rules to be followed when making new stuff
* All items need item_damage even if its 0
* For Armor, item_damage is the amount of damage it reduces but it is still called item_damage for consistency
* Armors have subtypes, Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings and Boots that must be present when making a piece of armor
* Jobs dont need a required item, it can be set to None 
* Jobs also dont need a required hours, it can be set to 0
* Only beginner jobs should have no required item or hours, all other jobs should have required hours and better pay based on it 
* When Generating Jobs a Job must have 1 minigame of each type, Order, Trivia, Retype, Backwards, Hangman, Anagram, and must follow the rules for each minigame type
* these are the only Job minigames: Order, Trivia, Retype, Backwards, Hangman, Anagram
* for Retype, they must have at least 10 different phrases
* for Backwards, they must have at least 10 different words
* for Trivia, they must have at least 10 different questions
* for Order, they must have at least 5 different sequences
* for Order, they must have at least 4 different items in each sequence
* for Hangman they must have at least 10 different sentences
* for Anagram they must have at least 8 different words
* when Generating jobs, please give each minigame at least 10 rewards of differing money and xp amounts
* only one job minigame per job should have a chance for an item reward
* the xp needed for a user to level up is 6 times their level and does not overflow after a user levels up, keep this in mind when giving out xp rewards
* jobs must have multiple rewards with different amounts for each minigame
* search locations must have at least 15 comments each
* all generated stuff must be given back in json format
* when I ask you to create stuff, I mean give it back to me in json format, I will handle the rest
* FOLLOW EVERY RULE AT ALL TIMES WHEN CREATING STUFF WITH THE TEMPLATES, which are below
