I am going to give you a bunch of templates of stuff in my game, I want you to procces and understand them as Im going to ask you to generate more stuff based on them, once you understand all of them, say so followed by a ✅

Here are some rules to be followed when making new stuff
* All items need item_damage even if its 0
* For Armor, item_damage is the amount of damage it reduces but it is still called item_damage for consistency
* Armors have subtypes, Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings and Boots that must be present when making a piece of armor
* Jobs dont need a required item, it can be set to None 
* Jobs also dont need a required hours, it can be set to 0
* Only beginner jobs should have no required item or hours, all other jobs should have required hours and better pay based on it 
* When Generating Jobs, they must have Mnigames and they must have at least 8 minigames
* for Retype, Backwards, Anagram, and Hangman, they must have at least 10 different options
* when Generating jobs, please give each minigame at least 5 rewards of differing money and xp amounts
* only one job minigame per job should have a chance for an item reward
* the xp needed for a user to level up is 6 times their level and does not overflow after a user levels up, keep this in mind when giving out xp rewards
* jobs must have multiple rewards with different amounts for each minigame
* all generated stuff must be given back in json format
* FOLLOW EVERY RULE AT ALL TIMES WHEN CREATING STUFF WITH THE TEMPLATES, which are below
