I am going to give you a bunch of object templates from my game, a list of everything in the game to be used as a reference, and a bunch of rules that need to be followed at all time when generating content with the templates 

each rule is marked with a • and continues till the next •
Rules: 
    •If you run out of characters to respond with, please tell me and offer to continue from where you left off
    •When creating a certain game object, you must follow its specific rules and template always
    •Only Enemies and Weapons get quotes; they must be in the format that is displayed in the template and must contain each of the three items in the {}
    •There must be at least 8 unique quotes for each item or enemy generated
    •There must be at least 8 unique outcomes for structure generated
    •The Item Types are, Consumable, Badge, Weapon, Armor, Material, and Misc
    •Structures only have the options, (item_gain, item_loss, health_loss, health_gain, money_gain, money_loss, spawn), no others will work
    •There are only three item elements and they can only work on weapons, Fire, Paralysis, and Poison, if the item effect would be "Burn", Replace it with "Fire"
    •If possible, dont use item elements, create weapons with the item_element of None
    •Every item needs "item_damage", even if its 0, it needs to be there
    •for Armor, "item_damage", refers to how much damage the armor piece blocks when the user wearing it is attacked, it is still called "item_damage" in the code though
    •Armors have subtypes, Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings and Boots that must be present when making a piece of armor
    •Item effects must be formated like so {effect} +/- {number}, EX. health + 10, and an item can only have 1 effect
    •There are only specific item effects, they are (health, damage, luck, crit_chance, dodge_chance, fire_resistance, paralysis_resistance, poison_resistance, and frost_resistance)
    •Outcomes need to have xp, the "outcome_xp" can not be 0
    •The only Quest Types are "collect" and "kill"
    •Mana does not exist, nothing to do with mana should be created
    •If an item has a recipe, its recpie_id needs to be the same as the item_id
    •Badges and Pets are Equippable
    •chests need chest contents and chests arent allowed to be empty
    •If asked to coninue, start the codeblock from where it was left off
    •Whenever anything is created, refrence the list of things in the game and if anything that isnt on the list is mentioned, create it following the inital creation
    •Split Each Category into its own codeblock
    •this is what I mean by add chances of getting more than 1 of an item, create more outcomes with different chances and different ammounts
            {
                "item_id": "rat_tail",
                "item_amount": 1,
                "drop_chance": 0.5
            },
            {
                "item_id": "rat_tail",
                "item_amount": 2,
                "drop_chance": 0.3
            },
    
    •Create image promps for every structure you create and use this as an example of a prompt, (It must always be in 32-bit pixel art)
        started with: 32-bit pixel art, Death Knights Castle
        gave: /imagine prompt: 32-bit pixel art, Death Knights Castle, a towering fortress of black stone, glowing with eerie green lights from the windows, surrounded by a moat of bubbling lava, a sense of foreboding and danger permeates the scene, Pixel Art, created with a palette of dark and vibrant colors to emphasize the contrast, --ar 16:9 --v 5
    •When I ask for you to create a new branch, what I mean is that a branch consists of "2 or more, new enemies, a new boss, a bunch of new items (armor sets, materials, weapons, pets, badges and unique items, weapons or armor (unique in the way of unique items in games have unique names, descriptions.. etc)), new quests, and a new structure to house and spawn those new enemies and boss"

once all the rules are understood, please tell me what the rule is, followed by what it means for you and generated content, then a ✅, please only say each rule once

this is all the object templates for the game
